##EdificeVR

This is a very, very simple project that was used as a visual aid during a short presentation on the history of Philippine architecture. The building shown in the presentation is a rough (and very inaccurate) model of the PhilCITE building. The historical building was designed by Locsin during the Marcos era as one part of the CCP Complex. It was demolished in the 90s to make way for Star City.

The compiled apk requires a compatible phone with the GearVR to run. 

For reference: it was used on a Samsung Galaxy S7 with the 1st generation of the GearVR.
